This code was generated as part of the InterBIO 2024 project collaboration with Elysium Health.

The analysis here assesses signial significance for methylation sites on the Elysium Health APEX array for over 2300 samples. The analysis uses Kruskal-Wallace testing to get significance values, then plots these values based on chromosomal position throughout the genome.
